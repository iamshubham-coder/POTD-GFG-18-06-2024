No. of rectangle in a circle
THE PROBLEM CAN BE THOUGHT AS TRYING TO FIT A RECTANGLE OF CERTAIN SIZEEITH IN A CIRCLE 
BASIC APPROACH

1)Calculate the bounding box: The maximum width and height of the rectangle that can fit inside the circle will be  
2R, which is the diameter of the circle.

2)Iterate through possible positions: You need to check each possible position where the bottom-left corner of the rectangle can be placed such that the entire rectangle stays within the circle.

3)Check if the rectangle fits: For each position, check if all corners of the rectangle lie within the circle.
